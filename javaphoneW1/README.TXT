PROJECT NOTES
-------------
In this second version of the javaphone the following facilities have been included
- Battery always full charged by constructor
- Signal level always full signal
- Text typed on the screen wraps to multiple lines when necessary
- You can include “\n” in text being displayed on the screen to move on to the next display line
- The method setPrompt(String s) can be used to display a prompt on the bottom line of the screen.
  This does not interfere with text being typed by the user. For example
  setPrompt(“Enter message”) displays “Enter message” in the prompt area and
  setPrompt(“”) clears the prompt area



 
LEARNING NOTES
--------------
The key concepts introduced in this example are
    - use of sequence, selection and iteration
    - identifcation of SOME (note, only some) of the methods provided by the String API
    - creating methods with and without return values
    - crude but fun example of pirate talk!
